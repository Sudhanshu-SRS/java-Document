## 🌐 **Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Netlify**

### **Method A: Drag & Drop (Easiest - 5 Minutes)**

1. **Prepare Your Frontend**

   ```powershell
   # Go to your frontend folder
   cd "c:\Users\SUDHANSHU\Desktop\java Document\webpage\frontend"

   # Create a .zip file with all contents
   # Or just select all files in the folder
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**

   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up (free account)
   - Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
   - **Drag the entire `frontend` folder** to the page
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - You get a URL like: `https://amazing-docs-123456.netlify.app`

3. **Test Your Website**
   - Open the Netlify URL
   - Should see your documentation dashboard
   - ✅ **Your website is now live!**

### **Method B: GitHub Integration (Auto-Updates)**

1. **Connect GitHub to Netlify**

   ```powershell
   # First, push your code to GitHub
   cd "c:\Users\SUDHANSHU\Desktop\java Document"
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy documentation website"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via GitHub**

   - Netlify dashboard → "New site from Git"
   - Choose "GitHub" → Authorize Netlify
   - Select your `java-Document` repository
   - **Build Settings**:
     - Base directory: `webpage/frontend`
     - Publish directory: `webpage/frontend`
     - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Auto-Updates**
   - Now when you update GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys
   - Team can always access latest version

## 🔧 **Step 2: Deploy Backend (Optional but Recommended)**

### **Why Deploy Backend?**

- ✅ **Persistent Data** - Team assignments saved forever
- ✅ **Real-time Sync** - Multiple people can use simultaneously
- ✅ **Professional** - No localStorage limitations

### **Deploy Backend to Railway (Free & Easy)**

1. **Create Railway Account**

   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with your GitHub account (free)

2. **Deploy Backend**

   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your `java-Document` repository
   - Select `webpage/backend` folder

3. **Set Environment Variables**

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://sudhanshusakhare808:Sudhanshu121@java-documents.jk4k11n.mongodb.net/
   CLIENT_URL=https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Get Backend URL**
   - Railway gives you a URL like: `https://web-production-abc123.up.railway.app`
   - **Save this URL!**

### **Connect Frontend to Backend**

1. **Update Frontend API URL**

   ```javascript
   // In webpage/frontend/app.js, change:
   const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3001/api";

   // To your Railway URL:
   const API_BASE_URL = "https://web-production-abc123.up.railway.app/api";
   ```

2. **Redeploy Frontend**
   - If using drag & drop: Upload the updated frontend folder again
   - If using GitHub: Push the changes, Netlify auto-deploys
