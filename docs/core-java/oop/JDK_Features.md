# 📘 JDK (Java Development Kit): Beginner Theory Guide

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Java Development Kit (JDK)** is a software development environment used to create Java applications. It provides all the tools needed to **write, compile, debug, and run Java programs**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will be able to:

- Understand what JDK is and what it includes.
- Use JDK to compile and run Java programs.
- Write and test basic to advanced Java code using JDK.
- Avoid common beginner mistakes when working with JDK.
- Apply JDK knowledge in real-world Java projects.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

You should have:

- Basic knowledge of what **programming** is.
- Familiarity with **command-line or terminal** usage.
- **Java installed** on your system (JDK setup).

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### What is JDK?

- **JDK** is a toolkit for Java developers.
- It includes:
  - **JRE** (Java Runtime Environment): Needed to **run** Java programs.
  - **JVM** (Java Virtual Machine): Executes the compiled bytecode.
  - **javac** (Java Compiler): Converts `.java` files to `.class` bytecode.
  - **Java libraries & APIs**: Pre-written code to use in your programs.

### JDK vs JRE vs JVM

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| JVM | Runs Java bytecode |
| JRE | Provides libraries + JVM |
| JDK | Full development kit (includes JRE + tools) |

---

## 💡 Code Examples

### 🔹 Basics

**HelloWorld.java**
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
**Compile & Run (CMD/Terminal):**
```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

---

### 🔸 Intermediate

**Class with Method and Loop**
```java
public class Greetings {
    public static void sayHello(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};
        for (String name : names) {
            sayHello(name);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### 🔺 Advanced

**Using OOP Concepts**
```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;

    Car(String brand, int speed) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(brand + " runs at " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", 120);
        car1.display();
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always save files with `.java` extension and class name = file name.
- Use proper naming conventions (e.g., class names start with uppercase).
- Keep your code modular (use methods/classes).
- Comment your code for better readability.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- **Mismatched file and class name** (e.g., `Hello.java` vs `HelloWorld` class).
- **Forgetting to compile** before running (`javac` step).
- **Case sensitivity**: Java is case-sensitive.
- **Incorrect PATH setup**: If `javac` doesn’t work, JDK may not be added to system PATH.

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Exercises

1. Write a Java program to add two numbers.
2. Create a `Person` class with name and age, and display details.
3. Write a loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
4. Create a class `Student` with methods `study()` and `attendExam()`.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

- Developing Android Apps (with Android Studio + JDK)
- Building Web Applications using Java EE or Spring Boot
- Desktop GUI apps using JavaFX or Swing
- Enterprise software (banking, healthcare systems)

---

## 🔗 Integration with Other Topics

| Topic | How It Relates |
|-------|----------------|
| **OOP** | JDK helps build Java's object-oriented programs |
| **IDE** (Eclipse, IntelliJ) | IDEs use JDK in the backend to compile/run |
| **APIs** | Use JDK's Java API libraries |
| **Frameworks** (Spring, Hibernate) | Require JDK for compilation and execution |

## 💡 Tips for Success

- Practice compiling and running from terminal to learn fundamentals.
- Use an IDE for large projects (Eclipse, IntelliJ).
- Debug often using `System.out.println()`.
- Learn Java syntax well — it's strict but powerful.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `javac not recognized` | Add JDK `bin` folder to system PATH |
| Compilation error | Check for typos, correct syntax |
| Class not found | Ensure correct file name and class name |
| Can't run .java file directly | Compile it first: `javac File.java` then run with `java ClassName` |
