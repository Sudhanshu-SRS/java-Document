# Method Reference in Java – Full Guide

## ✨ Overview
Method References are a shorthand notation of lambda expressions used to refer to methods directly by name, without invoking them. Introduced in Java 8, they help write clean, readable, and concise code, especially when working with functional interfaces.

---

## 🌟 Learning Objectives
By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to:

- Understand what method references are and how they work
- Differentiate between the types of method references
- Replace lambdas with method references where applicable
- Use method references in real-life Java applications
- Avoid common mistakes while using them

---

## 🧱 Prerequisites
Before learning Method References, you should know:

- Basic Java syntax
- Object-oriented concepts
- Functional Interfaces
- Lambda expressions

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

1. **Functional Interface** – Interface with a single abstract method (e.g., `Runnable`, `Comparator`)
2. **Lambda Expression** – Anonymous functions to pass behavior
3. **Method Reference** – Compact syntax to refer to a method using `::` operator
4. **Types of Method References:**
   - Static Method (`ClassName::staticMethod`)
   - Instance Method of an object (`object::instanceMethod`)
   - Instance Method of a class (`ClassName::instanceMethod`)
   - Constructor Reference (`ClassName::new`)

---

## 💻 Code Examples

### 🔹 Basics

#### 1. Static Method Reference
```java
class Utility {
    public static void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable r = Utility::greet;
        r.run();  // Output: Hello, World!
    }
}
```

### 🔸 Intermediate Code

#### 2. Instance Method Reference of an Object
```java
class Printer {
    void print(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        Consumer<String> consumer = printer::print;
        consumer.accept("Printing via method reference");
    }
}
```

#### 3. Instance Method of a Class
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("john", "Alice", "bob");
        names.sort(String::compareToIgnoreCase);
        System.out.println(names);  // [Alice, bob, john]
    }
}
```

### 🔶 Advanced Code

#### 4. Constructor Reference
```java
import java.util.function.Supplier;

class Employee {
    public Employee() {
        System.out.println("Employee created!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Supplier<Employee> supplier = Employee::new;
        Employee emp = supplier.get();
    }
}
```

#### 5. Combined Use with Streams
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry");

        list.stream()
            .map(String::toUpperCase)
            .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
```

## ✅ Best Practices
- Use method reference when the lambda just calls an existing method.
- Keep it readable – if it confuses the reader, prefer a lambda.
- Avoid overusing – use where it simplifies code.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Trying to use method references when parameters don’t match
- Confusing between different types (e.g., instance vs static)
- Using with non-functional interfaces

---

## ✍️ Hands-on Exercises
1. Create a list of integers and print only even numbers using `Predicate` and method reference.
2. Sort a list of custom `Employee` objects by name using method reference.
3. Create a constructor reference for a `Student` class and generate objects with it.

---

## 🌍 Real World Application
- Used heavily in **Streams API** for clean data processing
- **Event handling** in JavaFX/Swing
- **Callbacks** in functional programming
- **Cleaner code** in APIs like `CompletableFuture`, `Optional`

---

## 🔗 Integration with Other Topics
- **Lambda Expressions** – Often interchangeable
- **Streams** – Method references shine in `map`, `filter`, `forEach`
- **Functional Interfaces** – You pass method references to them
- **Optional API** – Uses them frequently in `ifPresent`, `map`, etc.

## 💡 Tips for Success
- Practice replacing lambda expressions with method references
- Understand the **functional interface's method signature**
- Visualize what's being passed – method references are not called immediately, just passed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
| Problem                        | Cause                                      | Fix                                  |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| “Cannot resolve method”        | Method reference doesn’t match interface   | Check parameters and return types    |
| Compilation error             | Referencing instance method from static    | Create object or make method static  |
| Method reference not readable | Overuse or complex reference               | Prefer lambda if it’s clearer         |
