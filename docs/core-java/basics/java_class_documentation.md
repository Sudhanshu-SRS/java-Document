# Class in Java

## üìñ Overview

A **class** in Java is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. Classes are fundamental to Java's object-oriented programming model and promote code reuse, encapsulation, and modularity.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After reading this documentation, you will be able to:

- Understand the purpose and structure of a class in Java
- Create and use classes to instantiate objects
- Differentiate between fields, methods, and constructors in a class
- Implement and use classes effectively in Java programs

## ‚ö° Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic programming constructs (variables, functions)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Basic knowledge of Java syntax

## üîë Key Concepts

### Class Definition

A class is defined using the `class` keyword.

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving.");
    }
}
```

### Object Instantiation

Objects are instances of a class, created using the `new` keyword.

```java
Car myCar = new Car();
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.drive();
```

### Constructors

A constructor is a special method that initializes new objects.

```java
public class Car {
    String color;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String c) {
        color = c;
    }
}
```

## üíª Code Examples

### Basic Example

```java
// Title: Defining and Using a Simple Class
// Description: This example shows how to define a class and create an object

public class BasicExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Define and create a Car object
        Car myCar = new Car();

        // Step 2: Assign a value to its field
        myCar.color = "Blue";

        // Step 3: Call its method
        myCar.drive();

        // Output explanation
        System.out.println("Expected output: The car is driving.");
    }
}
```

### Intermediate Example

```java
// Title: Constructor Usage
// Description: Demonstrates use of constructors to initialize objects

public class IntermediateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Black");
        System.out.println("Car color: " + myCar.color);
    }
}
```

### Advanced Example

```java
// Title: Full-featured Class with Methods
// Description: Shows encapsulation and method calls

public class AdvancedExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("White", 80);
        myCar.drive();
        myCar.accelerate();
    }
}

class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    public Car(String c, int s) {
        color = c;
        speed = s;
    }

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving at speed: " + speed + " km/h");
    }

    void accelerate() {
        speed += 20;
        System.out.println("Accelerated speed: " + speed);
    }
}
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

1. **Use Meaningful Class Names**

   - Class names should reflect their purpose
   - Helps in code readability and maintenance

2. **Encapsulate Fields**

   - Use private fields and public getters/setters
   - Enhances data security and integrity

3. **Keep Class Responsibilities Focused**
   - Follow Single Responsibility Principle
   - Makes testing and debugging easier

## ‚ùå Common Pitfalls

1. **Not Using Constructors Properly**

   ```java
   // Wrong way
   Car myCar = new Car;
   ```

   ```java
   // Correct way
   Car myCar = new Car();
   ```

   **Why this matters**: Constructors are methods and require parentheses.

2. **Accessing Fields Without Initialization**

   - Can lead to `NullPointerException`

3. **Class Name Not Matching File Name**

   - Java requires the public class name to match the filename.

## üîß Hands-On Exercise

### Exercise: Create a Student Class

**Objective**: Define a class with fields and methods to store and print student details.

**Requirements**:

- Fields: name, roll number
- Method: displayDetails()

**Starter Code**:

```java
// TODO: Complete the following class
public class Student {
    String name;
    int rollNumber;

    // Add a method to display details
    void displayDetails() {
        // Complete this method
    }
}
```

**Solution Hints**:

- Use `System.out.println()`
- Format output neatly

**Expected Output**:

```
Name: John Doe
Roll Number: 101
```

## üöÄ Real-World Applications

### Use Case 1: Employee Management System

Classes are used to model employees with properties like name, ID, and salary.

### Use Case 2: Banking Systems

Each customer and account can be represented as a class with operations like deposit, withdraw, etc.

## üîó Integration with Other Topics

- **Related to Object-Oriented Programming**: Foundation of OOP concepts
- **Prerequisite for Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Classes are required to understand advanced OOP features
- **Combines with Packages and Interfaces**: Organizing and extending classes

## üí° Tips for Success

- Practice creating and using different classes
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Understand the difference between static and instance members

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Error: Cannot find symbol

**Cause**: Referring to a variable or method that hasn't been declared
**Solution**: Ensure all names are correctly spelled and declared

```java
System.out.println(name); // if 'name' is not declared, error
```

### Common Error: Constructor not defined

**Cause**: Missing constructor or incorrect parameters
**Solution**: Define a matching constructor or adjust the instantiation
